## Introduction:
The Celestial Bodies Dataset was scraped from Wikipedia using requests and BeautifulSoup for
scraping data on a wide array of celestial objects: planets, stars, moons, and galaxies. This project cleaned
the dataset and performed EDA on it to understand the structure of the data, find any possible insights, and
prepare the data for modeling and prediction in the future.

#### Dataset Name: Celestial Bodies Dataset
#### Source: Wikipedia

## Objective:
This analysis focuses on collecting and analyzing data from celestial bodies like planets, stars, moons,
galaxies, and other relevant objects in astronomy. Using the publicly available dataset from Wikipedia, we
want to find insights using higher-order data analysis methods that can reveal information about text and
image data. Cleaning of data, exploratory analysis, and visualization will be performed, including the
application of machine learning models for further investigation.
### Relevance:
The dataset is helpful in analyzing celestial bodies as it encompasses different types like planets,
stars, moons, and other celestial entities. From this analysis, the insight about celestial body type and their
characteristic features would be gained, which helps in building the classification models.
